# The Countdown app

Application that displays a countdown to a given date. It comes with a plethora of features such as custom date entries, theming etc.
Oh and not forgetting the beloved dark mode! <br>
Just save the date and let the countdown begin!


App deployed on netlify at https://rcountdown.netlify.app/
<br><br>


## Running the application in development on your device- For developers

- Clone the repository using 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RDjarbeng/countdown.git
cd countdown
```
- Install dependencies, we used vite for bundling as a dev dependency
```
npm install
```
- View the application using vite by launching the dev server with
```
npm run dev
```

- Or alternatively use live server extension in vscode to view the application. NB: Vite is recommended because you might run into some minor issues with live server in vscode

### Building for production
Use
```
npm run build
```
This will create a build directory `/dist` with the bundled assets and pages as a Progressive Web App (PWA). You could open the index.html file generated with this build from your file explorer but a better option is to run:

```
npm run preview
```
This provides a link to the built website with the PWA ready to go, useful for testing the build before deploying
Note that after building some assets such as css, js may have a hash/string of characters added to their name. It's vite's way of keeping track of files, so don't worry the application should still build.

If you make changes that involve addition of new pages or routes you have to update the vite.config.js to ensure the new page is included in the bundling.
It's a pain we knowðŸ˜ª. But on the bright side it takes care of the PWA configuration and allowing the users to updating the application with the new version.
